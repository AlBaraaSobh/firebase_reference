# ðŸ”¥ Firebase Reference

A demo project using **Flutter + Firebase** aimed at providing **reference classes** for Firebase integration.  
This is not a final app and does not focus on UI design, but rather serves as a code reference.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
- Reference for Firebase-related classes.
- Examples of CRUD operations (Create â€“ Read â€“ Update â€“ Delete).
- Reusable code for future projects.

## ðŸš€ Usage
1. Copy the classes from the `lib/` folder into your project.
2. Add your own Firebase configuration.
3. Use the code as a starting point for your apps.
